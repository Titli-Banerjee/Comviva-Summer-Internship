    "# Content Based Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple approach of recommending items based on the attributes of the item itself. For example, \n",
    "if we know that someone enjoys watching movies of a particular genre, we would try to recommned the person \n",
    "other movies of the same genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will look at the product description of the items that a user has already purchased, and\n",
    "recommend items that are similar to the item already purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most prominent advantage of this system is that, it does not require a big user base to recommend items. This way it avoids the 'cold start' problem. Since content can be present in varied form, they open up the options to use different approaches like: text processing techniques, the use of semantic information etc.\n"
